## Materialist Feminism / Decolonization

### Already have read and recommend:

 - **Beyond Negativity: What Comes After Gender Nihilism?** - Alyson Escalante

 Fairly short primer on materialist feminism. Personally introduced me to Monique Wittig. Far from perfect but an amazing taste of what a proper feminism could look like.

 - **Racism, Sexism, Ideology and Power** - Colette Guillaumin 
 
 What marxist feminism should have been. A genuinely materialist account of the systems of sex and race. Something not really found almost anywhere else. 
 
 - **The Straight Mind and Other Essays** - Monique Wittig

 First 3-4 essays are the best. All are good, however. Critiques the concept of sex, establishes the idea that lesbians are not women when sex is understood in a materialist fashion, and generally expands on how feminists should oppose naturalized systems. 
 
 - **Black Skin White Masks** - Frantz Fanon 

 A really profound account of the psychological effects of alienation. Fanon is one of the most important theorists ever, read him.
 
 - **Towards a Decolonial Feminism** - Maria Lugones
 
 Pretty great attempt at making decolonization more explicitly feminist. A bit overly academic imo but still a good read. 

 - **Marxism Without Male Supremacy** - Carol Giardina 

 Huge part of getting me interested in non-marxist materialist feminisms. Not the best essay for a number of reasons but puts forward some very interesting critiques. Only available on redstockings.org afaik. 

### Want to read but seems worth reading: 

  - Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique - Sally Haslanger 

 Seems to be problematizing the understanding of social constructs as purely ideological phenomena in a similar way to Colette Guillaumin.
