## Materialist Feminism / Decolonization

### **Already have read and recommend:**

 - **Beyond Negativity: What Comes After Gender Nihilism?** - Alyson Escalante

 Fairly short primer on materialist feminism. Personally introduced me to Monique Wittig. Far from perfect but an amazing taste of what a proper feminism could look like.

 - **Racism, Sexism, Ideology and Power** - Colette Guillaumin 
 
 What marxist feminism should have been. A genuinely materialist account of the systems of sex and race. Something not really found almost anywhere else. 
 
 - **The Straight Mind and Other Essays** - Monique Wittig

 First 3-4 essays are the best. All are good, however. Critiques the concept of sex, establishes the idea that lesbians are not women when sex is understood in a materialist fashion, and generally expands on how feminists should oppose naturalized systems. 
 
 - **Black Skin White Masks** - Frantz Fanon 

 A really profound account of the psychological effects of alienation. Fanon is one of the most important theorists ever, read him.
 
 - **Towards a Decolonial Feminism** - Maria Lugones
 
 Pretty great attempt at making decolonization more explicitly feminist. A bit overly academic imo but still a good read. 

 - **Marxism Without Male Supremacy** - Carol Giardina 

 Huge part of getting me interested in non-marxist materialist feminisms. Not the best essay for a number of reasons but puts forward some very interesting critiques. Only available on redstockings.org afaik. 
 
 - **The Wretched of the Earth** - Frantz Fanon

Discussion of the actual process of "the making of new men" described in his Black Skin White Masks. Incredibly important just please read after having a solid understanding of Black Skin White Masks.

 - **The Text as Body/Politics: An Appreciation of Monique Wittig’s Writings in Context** - Helene Wenzel

General discussion of Wittig, discusses her cooption by Écriture féminine. Great read for general history of the feminist movement. “Where it all went wrong”

### **Want to read but seems worth reading:**

  - **Close To Home** - Christine Delphy
 
 Considered by  many to be the quintessential work on Matfem. I have yet to read (oops) but I'm sure its a great read. 

  - **Materialist feminism and the politics of discourse** - Rosemary Hennessey

 Potentially a very good intro to matfem for people coming from more marxist aligned perspectives. Seems very well written. Need to investigate. 

  - **Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique** - Sally Haslanger 

 Seems to be problematizing the understanding of social constructs as purely ideological phenomena in a similar way to Colette Guillaumin. 
 
  - **Meditations of Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth** - James Yaki Sayles 

 Well known discussion of The Wretched of the Earth by a lifelong Black American activist.  
 
  - **What is Gender Nihilism: A Reader** - Various

Huge collection of essays including many materialist feminists. Probably very good. Seems to focus more on race too. 

  - **S.C.U.M. Manifesto** - Valerie Solanas

 People tend to disregard it as being biological essentialist but it seems remarkably charitable in a way biological essentialist list isn't known for. Great book, possible guidebook for how to write lol.
 
  - **The Second Sex** - Simone De Beauvoir 

Chronically misunderstood but I think definitely worth reading after doing due dilligence with context of what other feminist writers associated with her were arguing (Wittig, Guillaumin, Delphy). Left behind in the split over lesbianism, so always keep that in mind! 

  - **L’anatomie politique. Catégorisations et idéologies du sexe** - Nicole-Claude Mathieu

Seems great, unfortunately do not speak french! pain.. Part of Nouvelles Questions Feministes which was started with Wittig, Guillaumin and Delphy after the split over "the lesbian question".
